    Number used as logic:                      377 out of  69,120    1%
      Number using O6 output only:             262
      Number using O5 output only:              85
      Number using O5 and O6:                   30
    Number used as exclusive route-thru:         7
  Number of route-thrus:                        92

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                   186 out of  17,280    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:          485
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:           180 out of     485   37%
    Number with an unused LUT:                 101 out of     485   20%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:         204 out of     485   42%
    Number of unique control sets:              25
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              35 out of  69,120    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.
